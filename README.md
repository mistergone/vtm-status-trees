#Welcome to Status Trees Funtimes!

This project is silly and useless unless you happen to be interested in the relationships between positions and status in the Vampire: The Masquerade Mind's Eye Studio rules released by By Night Studios.

I'm silly, so it was fun to make.

Feel free to fork and do whatever. There is no license to this product. I also claim no copyright over the portions of the code that I wrote.

Note that this project uses Bootstrap and Arrows-and-Boxes, which have their own licenses and such.
